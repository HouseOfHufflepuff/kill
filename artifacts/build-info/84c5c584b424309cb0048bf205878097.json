@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.
